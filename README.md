# n_gram_models.ipynb

## Description:
The `n_gram_models.ipynb` notebook contains implementations of bigram and trigram models capable of autocompleting incomplete sentences and an auto spelling-corrector that effectively corrects any sentence. The techniques employed, common in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), include Kneser-Ney smoothing, Laplace smoothing, and beam search.

## Contents:

### 1. Bigram and Trigram Models:
- Implementation of bigram and trigram models for language modeling.
- Autocompletion functionality for incomplete sentences using the implemented models.

### 2. Auto Spelling-Corrector:
- Implementation of an auto spelling-corrector capable of effectively correcting any sentence.
- Utilization of common NLP techniques such as Kneser-Ney smoothing, Laplace smoothing, and beam search for efficient correction.

### 3. Levenshtein Distance:
- Includes a separate file with a basic implementation of Levenshtein distance.
- Application of Levenshtein distance on NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) data for various purposes.
